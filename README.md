# NexusCMS (archived 2007)
Attempt to implement ASP.NET MVC CMS with DAL layer inspired by Castle ActiveRecord project. Never finished...
MVC was implemented also thanks to Castle project which offered MVC before Microsoft introduced that as a build it feature in .NET Framework. 
Regards to [https://www.castleproject.org/] for their good work and effort!
